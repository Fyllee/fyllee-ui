# Bild Web Interface

A REST API static content hosting platform.

Bild was born from a problem I was encountering while creating SPAs with NextJS.
I couldn't dynamically add images to the images folder. So I had no place to store
my images, and globally, all my static content. From there came the idea to create
my own static content storage system. Configured according to my needs, and potentially
those of other developers who were facing the same problem as me.
